#Introduction
TOs (Tiny OS) kernel, written just for fun.  
In this project i use [JamesM's kernel development tutorials](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html)  
The idea of this project is from my friends Navid Mashayekhi and Mohammad Reza Mahboubi Ardakani.  
TOs originally supposed to be 64 bit kernel but until now it's just 32 bit kernel  
TOs use GRUB 1 for booting and strict to multiboot specification.

#Contribution

#Runing & Testing
I use bochs and qemu for test, so there is a shell script for these application and you can use them to run and test.
