##Tiny OS Kernel (TOs)

###Introduction
**Tiny OS Kernel (TOs)** is written just for fun. I'm making this kernel according to what I've learned from [JamesM's Kernel Development Tutorials](http://www.jamesmolloy.co.uk/tutorial_html/index.html). The idea of this project is from my friends Navid Mashayekhi and Mohammad Reza Mahboubi Ardakani. **TOs** was originally supposed to be a 64 bit kernel but until now, it is just a 32 bit kernel. **TOs** uses **GRUB 1.0** for booting and follows the multiboot specification.

###Running and Testing
I use **bochs** and **qemu** for emulation purposes. So, I've made a few shell scripts to start these emulators. You can find them under directory [scripts](https://github.com/1995parham/TOs/tree/master/script).  Once the emulator is started, you are free to run and test the **TOs**.
